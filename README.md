**Project Summary:**

The purpose of the Project is to analyse whether changes in average temperature and average level of rainfall affect the change in the average price on potatoes in Peru in 2006-2015 years. For that, we used the retail potato prices data from the World Food Program's Global Food Prices data (https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/global-food-prices) and data of Peru monthly average temperature and rainfall of 2006-2015 (http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportal/index.cfm?page=downscaled_data_download&menu=historical).

Our **dependent variable** is a retail price of potato in Peru in 2006-2015 (1 unit = 5 kg, in Peruvian Sol). The **independent (explanatory) variables** we use are near surface monthly mean air temperature (in Â°C) and monthly precipitation sums (in mm) in Peru in 2006-2015.

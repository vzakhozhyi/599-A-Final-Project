**Project Summary:**

The purpose of the Project is to analyse whether changes in average temperature and average level of rainfall affect the change in the average price on potatoes in Peru in 2006-2015 years. For that, we used the retail potato prices data from the World Bank (https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/global-food-prices) and data of Peru monthly average temperature and railfall of 2006-2015 (http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportal/index.cfm?page=downscaled_data_download&menu=historical).

Our **dependent variable** is a retail price of potato in Peru in 2006-2015. The **independent (explanatory) variables** we use are monthly average temperature and rainfall in Peru in 2006-2015.
